# Porting ollvm (Hikari) to llvm+clang21.0

[中文](RE) | [English](README_en.md)

The existing ollvm [repository](https://github.com/GreenDamTan/llvm-project_ollvm) is based on `llvm+clang17.06`, which is  outdated. To learn about the new `import` feature in C++, I decided to port [ollvm(Hikari)](https://github.com/61bcdefg/Hikari-LLVM15) ~~copy~~ port it to llvm+clang21.0.  
If you find this project helpful, please give it a `star`⭐.

## Hikari-LLVM15 Project Link
The core implementation of the obfuscator is in [Hikari-LLVM15](https://github.com/61bcdefg/Hikari-LLVM15).

## For usage instructions, you can refer to:
[HikariObfuscator Wiki](https://github.com/HikariObfuscator/Hikari/wiki/Usage)

## Precompiled Version
You can download my precompiled version and directly replace it in the official `llvm+clang`.

## How to Compile It Yourself

The process is similar to this article. Detailed steps can be found in:  
[Build Clang-cl with ollvm functionality](https://www.bilibili.com/opus/943544163969794072)

Required tools: `VS Studio` + `CMake`
> I used the `MSVC` compiler. I haven't tested other compilers, but they should work too.

Find a space with enough storage:
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/lux-QAQ/ollvm-clang21.0.git -b clang+ollvm-21.0.0 --depth 1 --recursive
```
Create a build folder:
``` shell
mkdir build
cd build
```
Run the CMake configuration:
``` shell
cmake -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;lld;" -DLLVM_INCLUDE_DOCS=OFF -DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=OFF -DLLVM_INCLUDE_EXAMPLES=OFF -DLLVM_INCLUDE_BENCHMARKS=OFF -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -Thost=x64 ..\llvm
```
Here, I selected only `clang` and `lld`. If you need others, you can add them yourself.  
Next, go to the build folder, open the generated `LLVM.sln`, set the build configuration to `Release`, and compile `clang`.  
**Note**: The build will **consume a lot of memory (expected to exceed 25GB)**. If you run out of memory, please:
1. Reduce the maximum concurrency for building.
2. Increase virtual memory.

The initial build will take approximately 20 minutes.

After the build, you will find `clang.exe` and `clang++.exe` in the `Release/bin` directory. You need to download the official `llvm+clang`, then replace its `bin` folder with your compiled binaries.
> As of February 2025, the official release version is LLVM 20.1.0-rc1. However, I used the official `main` branch for compiling, so the version is 21.0.0. Therefore, there may be some unknown compatibility issues.

## Known Issues with the Current Version of ollvm
> As of February 2025

1. When compiling complex code with the `-mllvm -enable-allobf` flag to enable all obfuscators, it consumes **a lot of memory (memory requested could exceed 100GB)**, which may cause the computer to crash. This issue may be caused by memory leaks in the code. Do not enable all obfuscators for large projects.
2. When the `-enable-bcfobf` flag for false control flow is enabled, the code cannot contain code that catches exceptions (though throwing exceptions might be allowed). This causes the compiler to crash. This issue is said to be caused by the `fixstack` function in `ollvm`. To fix it, modifications may be required to the "EH return edges" and "invoke dominance relationships" (which I do not fully understand). **I hope someone with more expertise can fix this.**
3. `ollvm` impacts performance. Even with the `-O3` optimization flag, performance still decreases. If `-O0` is enabled, the program may not run properly.
4. Enabling compiler optimization options may reduce the effectiveness of the `ollvm` obfuscator. Therefore, choose optimization options based on your actual situation.

## Issues Encountered During Porting
I found that some code in `llvm/lib/Passes/PassBuilderPipelines.cpp` between llvm17.06 and 21.0 has changed. Based on my basic understanding, it seems that we need to determine when to import `ObfuscationPass()` into `MPM`. I followed the situation from the `llvm+clang17` version and imported `ObfuscationPass()` into `MPM`. However, there are some new situations in 21.0 that I’m not sure whether `ObfuscationPass()` should be added to `MPM` (I chose not to add it). So there may be some issues here that lead to degraded obfuscation performance.
